Hello! This project is a personal project to assist in my understanding of machine learning as I 
utilize different inputs and standards for testing with sklearn on python. As you'll see, I have two 
versions of salary regression models currently uploaded to test for seperate factors. Specifically, 
the V2 includes cross validation as my initial (V1) program was resulting in a significant mean standard 
error. I hoped the V2 would lower said error, yet I am still getting the same result. I am fairly confident 
this is due to overfitting as my sample size is fairly small and the cross validation and overall error 
checks are large scaled. My next steps for testing will be to analyze a much larger dataset with the program 
in an attempt to identify if the error will be lowered. I will also attempt to see if a much more linear dataset 
yields better results. As for now I have a fairly accurate R-squared variable and various graphs that are still 
usable.
